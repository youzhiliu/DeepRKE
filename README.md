# DeepRKE
DeepRKE, which depends on the combination of the original RNA sequence and RNA secondary structure sequence information and can effectively predict the binding site of RNA-protein. In our model, we use a novel type of feature expression to represent the original RNA sequence and secondary structure sequence: distributed representation of k-mers sequence to replace the traditional one-hot encoding.Compared with the traditional k-mers method, the distributed representation can effectively detect the latent relationship and similarity between k-mers. We input the distributed representations of sequences and secondary structures into convolutional neural networks (CNN) and bidirectional long-term short-term memory networks (BLSTM) to identify RBP binding sites. we evaluate DeepRKE with other five state-of-the-art methods on two large-scale benchmark datasets RBP-24 and RBP-31. Our results show that deepRKE has better performance on two large-scale RBP binding site datasets than the existing five state-of-the- art methods.
